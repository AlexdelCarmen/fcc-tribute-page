## My process

I started off by getting my assets and HTML boilerlplate, then building up the HTML skeleton and styling last based on the project's design. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Using Flexbox to align items within a container. 

```html
main {
  background-color: var(--light-color-1);
  width: 98%;
  margin: 1.5rem auto;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  color: var(--dark-color);
  border-radius: 5px;
}

```

### Continued development

Determining the size of items and the font family when coding based off of a third party design.
### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - i used W3Schools to get how to apply border radius to independent corners of an element.
